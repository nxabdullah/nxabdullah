Hey there!

I am Abdullah and I am a third year undergraduate at the University of Toronto, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I will be joining Xero as an Intern Software Engineer for my PEY Coop term this summer.

I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity, which is why I have focused my studies and career on machine learning and software engineering. In my professional work, I have had the opportunity to explore the complexities of analyzing and understanding large datasets, as well as designing and building software systems that can perform a variety of tasks. When I'm not working, I enjoy using my technical skills and creative eye to capture the beauty of cityscapes through photography.
