Hi there! My name is Abdullah and I am a software engineer with a focus on web development. I have a strong skillset in technologies like React and Django, and have experience building a wide range of applications using these frameworks. In addition to my web development skills, I am also interested in machine learning and am always looking for ways to incorporate this field into my projects. In my current role, I am responsible for designing and implementing new features for our product, as well as maintaining and improving the performance of our existing codebase. Thank you for visiting my profile!
